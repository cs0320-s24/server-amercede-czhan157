> **GETTING STARTED:** You must start from some combination of the CSV Sprint code that you and your partner ended up with. Please move your code directly into this repository so that the `pom.xml`, `/src` folder, etc, are all at this base directory.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: In order to run the server, run `mvn package` in your terminal then `./run` (using Git Bash for Windows users). This will be the same as the first Sprint. Take notice when transferring this run sprint to your Sprint 2 implementation that the path of your Server class matches the path specified in the run script. Currently, it is set to execute Server at `edu/brown/cs/student/main/server/Server`. Running through terminal will save a lot of computer resources (IntelliJ is pretty intensive!) in future sprints.
